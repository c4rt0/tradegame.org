**tradegame.org** is an open-source trading game based on real market data, built to learn how to trade stocks. 
Tradegame allows users to take part in an investment contest. Each user receives starting amount 
of virtual $100,000 and access to live asset data, fetched from an Alpaca.markets API. All users can see 
their performance in comparison to other investors on the ranking page ($ value of total assets). 
Each user can also watch assets in the additional ‘watchlist’ section. 
Users who would like to start the game again can reset their portfolio back to the original $100,000.
